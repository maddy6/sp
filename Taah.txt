Perfect üëå Thanks for sharing the reference 3-slide sample. I see the format clearly now:

Slide 1 = Background + Process Inefficiencies (Problem)

Slide 2 = Solution (data, ML models, workflows, etc.)

Slide 3 = Impact + Scalability + Future Scope


Now, I‚Äôll convert your one-slider ‚Äú24x7 AI Financial Analyst‚Äù into the same 3-slide format.

Slide 1 | Background & Process Inefficiencies

Objective: Build an always-available AI Financial Analyst (via MCP Server) to provide contextual & predictive insights for financial operations.

Background

Banks rely heavily on analysts for portfolio optimization, risk modeling, and regulatory reporting.

Analysts spend hours manually compiling data and validating results from fragmented systems.

Existing decision cycles are slow, error-prone, and reactive rather than predictive.


Process Inefficiencies

Delayed reporting & missed regulatory timelines.

Risk of inconsistent recommendations due to manual judgment.

Repetitive analyst effort on standard compliance and research tasks.

Lack of a centralized intelligent system that integrates across departments (Risk, Ops, Compliance, Markets).

Do you want me to design these 3 slides visually (with structure like your sample) so you can directly present, or should I just keep it as text content for now?
