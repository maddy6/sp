To perform an overlap analysis between score1 (new model) and score2 (old model), you can use the following approach:

Approach:

1. Bin the Scores: Since both scores range from 0-999, create bins (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, â€¦, 900-999) or use percentile-based bins.


2. Calculate Overlap: Compute the percentage of instances falling in the same bin for both scores.


3. Distribution Comparison: Plot histograms or KDE plots for score1 and score2.


4. Heatmap Analysis: Create a 2D histogram (heatmap) to visualize the joint distribution of score1 and score2.


5. Correlation Analysis: Check correlation (Pearson, Spearman) to measure relationship strength.

Python Code for Overlap Analysis

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Sample Data
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'score1': np.random.randint(0, 1000, 10000),
    'score2': np.random.randint(0, 1000, 10000),
    'count': np.random.randint(1, 10, 10000)
})

# Define Bins
bins = list(range(0, 1100, 100))  # 0-999 split into 10 bins
df['bin_score1'] = pd.cut(df['score1'], bins=bins, labels=bins[:-1])
df['bin_score2'] = pd.cut(df['score2'], bins=bins, labels=bins[:-1])

# Overlap Percentage Calculation
overlap_df = df[df['bin_score1'] == df['bin_score2']]
overlap_percentage = len(overlap_df) / len(df) * 100
print(f"Overlap Percentage: {overlap_percentage:.2f}%")

# Distribution Comparison
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
sns.histplot(df['score1'], bins=50, color='blue', label='New Model Score (score1)', alpha=0.5, kde=True)
sns.histplot(df['score2'], bins=50, color='red', label='Old Model Score (score2)', alpha=0.5, kde=True)
plt.legend()
plt.title("Score Distribution Comparison")
plt.xlabel("Score")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

# Heatmap for Score Overlap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
heatmap_data = pd.crosstab(df['bin_score1'], df['bin_score2'], values=df['count'], aggfunc='sum', normalize=True)
sns.heatmap(heatmap_data, cmap='coolwarm', annot=True, fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Overlap Heatmap Between score1 and score2")
plt.xlabel("Old Model Score Bins (score2)")
plt.ylabel("New Model Score Bins (score1)")
plt.show()

# Correlation Analysis
corr_pearson = df[['score1', 'score2']].corr(method='pearson').iloc[0, 1]
corr_spearman = df[['score1', 'score2']].corr(method='spearman').iloc[0, 1]
print(f"Pearson Correlation: {corr_pearson:.2f}")
print(f"Spearman Correlation: {corr_spearman:.2f}")

Key Insights from this Analysis

1. Overlap Percentage: How often score1 and score2 fall into the same bin.


2. Distribution Comparison: KDE plots show if the new model is assigning similar or different scores compared to the old model.


3. Heatmap Analysis: Identifies regions where score transitions happen between old and new models.


4. Correlation Analysis: Checks if score1 and score2 are strongly related.
