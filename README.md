8. Intelligent Servicing Agent for Operations Decision Bottlenecks
Domain: Ops / Strategy / Shared Services
Problem: Operational escalations (loan exceptions, wire rejections, treasury ops) pile up in queues waiting for human action.
Solution: GenAI-based Decision Agent trained on historical resolution data + policy manuals that recommends next-best actions with confidence scores and legal traceability



✅ Where is this happening?
In bank operations departments. Think:

Loan operations (approvals, exceptions, documentation issues)

Wire transfers (something got rejected, wrong SWIFT code, limit issues)

Treasury operations (delays in settlement, FX mismatches)

Escalations (customer or internal team sends “Hey, please fix this ASAP”)

❌ The Current Pain
Every day, thousands of issues get stuck in queues.

Each item is waiting for a human decision.

The decision depends on:

Historical cases (what we did last time)

Company rules and manuals

Regulatory policies (what RBI or FED allows)

Context of that specific customer (VIP vs regular, limits, etc.)

💡 The delay happens because a human needs to:

Read the escalation

Search policies and past emails

Think what action to take

Get it approved

🧠 What’s the Proposed Solution
We build an AI Decision Agent — an intelligent assistant that:

✅ Reads the case like a human (loan issue, wire error, etc.)

✅ Understands the context by:

Reading the escalation email or system ticket

Looking at past similar cases

Checking rules from bank manuals

✅ Suggests the best next action, like:

“Approve the wire but apply exception code 17”

“Send the loan to manual underwriting”

“Reject with reason XYZ, notify client”

✅ Shows a confidence score (e.g., 92% sure this is the right action)

✅ Cites why (like ChatGPT giving sources):

“Because similar case on 2023-11-02 was resolved this way”

“Policy says Section 2.1.3 allows this”

🔁 How Does It Work (Detailed Breakdown)
1. Data Collection
The agent learns from:

Historical case logs (loan issues, wire escalations, etc.)

Internal policy documents (SOPs, escalation rules, exception codes)

Regulatory documents (FEMA, FATF, internal compliance rules)

Chat logs or emails between teams

CRM or ticketing system data

➡️ Stored in a vector database or used to train LLM-based retrieval.

2. Language Model (GenAI)
You use a fine-tuned LLM or RAG system:

Trained or connected to your domain-specific knowledge base

It parses free-form text escalations like:

“Customer ABC tried to wire $1M but it was rejected due to KYC mismatch. Can we override since customer is a premium client?”

The model:

Identifies the key entities (customer, reason, amount, client type)

Matches similar past cases

Checks applicable rules

3. Decision Recommendation Engine
A lightweight ML classifier or GenAI agent:

Maps the input issue to one of predefined resolution paths (approve, escalate, reject, hold, manual review)

Uses confidence scoring, e.g., softmax outputs or few-shot prompting

Optional: Outputs a reasoning trace and asks for approval if confidence < threshold

4. Human-in-the-Loop Review
The agent doesn’t act directly — it suggests:

“Here’s what I think we should do”

“Here’s why I think so”

“Want to approve this?”

🧠 This makes it safe and auditable — human stays in control.

5. Feedback Loop
Every time a human:

Accepts the decision

Modifies it

Rejects it

...the feedback is captured and used to improve the model over time.

🧱 Tech Stack Example
Component	Tool/Tech
LLM	OpenAI GPT-4 / Mistral / Llama-3 (fine-tuned)
Document RAG	LangChain + Pinecone / Weaviate / ChromaDB
Ticket Parser	Named Entity Recognition + Prompt Templates
Policy Reader	PDF parsers + Embedding models (e.g., Cohere, SBERT)
Decision Engine	ML Classifier or Function-calling Agents
UI for Ops	Streamlit / React / ServiceNow plugin
Feedback Capture	Logging + Annotation Tool

💰 Value to Bank (Pitch This Hard)
Benefit	Description
⏱️ 60–80% Faster Resolution	Reduces bottlenecks in ops queues
💼 Saves FTE Hours	1,000s of ops decisions don’t need human lookup
✅ Better Accuracy	Less manual error, always references policy
🔐 Traceable Decisions	Audit trail with justification = regulator-ready
📈 Scales Fast	Trained once, handles 1000s of cases/day

🎤 How to Pitch It (Sample Pitch Line)
“We’re building an intelligent GenAI co-pilot for operations teams that acts like a junior analyst — reading escalations, suggesting the right actions, and explaining why — helping banks cut down ops backlog by 70%, while staying fully compliant.”

Great, thanks for sharing your initial documentation on Bayesian target encoding. Based on your WOE documentation format, here's the replicated structure for Bayesian Risk Scores in the same style:


---

1. Executive Summary

Bayesian Risk Score Calculation

Bayesian encoded values are derived analytically using both global and category-specific historical data distributions.

All categories are treated uniformly under the same smoothing-based Bayesian formulation.

Encoded risk score values fall within a bounded range influenced by the category mean and global mean, thereby offering calibrated risk estimates.


Usage in Model

Bayesian scores replace original categorical variables in model development and are treated as independent continuous numeric variables.

No further clusters or manual groupings were created for modeling.


Score Update for Model in Production

The encoded Bayesian risk scores are recalculated using the latest available category-wise performance data.

A BAU process has been set up to review fraud performance and drift on a monthly basis. If the encoded risk for certain categories no longer aligns with observed trends (e.g., increased fraud in previously low-risk categories), the shrinkage factor or smoothing may be recalibrated.

Full recalibration of Bayesian encoding parameters is performed semi-annually as part of model maintenance, with monthly monitoring for score drift or deterioration.




---

2. Introduction

2.1 Objective

To convert categorical variables into meaningful numeric scores that capture the fraud risk associated with each category, reducing noise from sparse levels and avoiding overfitting.

Bayesian risk scoring is an alternate encoding strategy similar to WOE that balances local (category-level) performance with global behavior.

2.2 List of Categorical Variables for Bayesian Encoding

Below is the list of categorical variables for which Bayesian encoding was performed in the CP/CNP fraud models:


---

3. Bayesian Risk Score Calculation Process

A 4-step process was used to generate the Bayesian encoded values:

1. Data Aggregation

Summarize the data at the category level (e.g., for each MCC), collecting:

Total Transactions

Total Frauds

Fraud Rate = Total Frauds / Total Transactions




2. Bayesian Formula Application

For each category:




\text{Encoded Value} = \mu_{\text{global}} + (\mu_{\text{category}} - \mu_{\text{global}}) \times \text{Shrinkage Factor}

- \mu_{\text{global}} = Global average fraud rate
 - \mu_{\text{category}} = Average fraud rate within category
 - Shrinkage Factor = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(n - \text{min_samples_leaf}) / \text{smoothing})}

3. Smoothing & Shrinkage

This step ensures that rare categories (with low transaction volumes) are pulled closer to the global mean to prevent overfitting.

The smoothing hyperparameter is tuned based on historical fraud distributions.



4. Default Handling

For categories not present in development data but encountered in production, the encoded value defaults to the global fraud rate or medium-risk category value based on business justification.





---

4. Usage in CRS ML Model

Bayesian encoded variables directly replace original categorical fields during model training.

They are treated as independent continuous numeric features.

No interaction terms or grouping were done unless mentioned specifically under modeling interactions.

Variable importance and impact on model predictions were analyzed and are included in supporting documentation.

To analyze score-bin-wise performance, you can follow this structured approach:

Approach:

1. Create Score Bins: Divide score1 and score2 into bins (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, …, 900-999).


2. Aggregate Performance Metrics: Calculate fraud rate (fraud_ind mean), count of transactions, and percentage contribution within each bin.


3. Compare Performance Across Bins: Show how fraud rates change between score1 and score2 for each bin.

To perform an overlap analysis between score1 (new model) and score2 (old model), you can use the following approach:

Approach:

1. Bin the Scores: Since both scores range from 0-999, create bins (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, …, 900-999) or use percentile-based bins.


2. Calculate Overlap: Compute the percentage of instances falling in the same bin for both scores.


3. Distribution Comparison: Plot histograms or KDE plots for score1 and score2.


4. Heatmap Analysis: Create a 2D histogram (heatmap) to visualize the joint distribution of score1 and score2.


5. Correlation Analysis: Check correlation (Pearson, Spearman) to measure relationship strength.
