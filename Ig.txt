📦 2. Workflow Overview: Customer to Activated Service

Let’s go step-by-step like a real onboarding case.


---

📌 Scenario:

A U.S.-based Delaware C-Corp startup wants to open a business account + FX hedging + credit facility at Citibank.


---

👣 Step-by-Step Workflow

🔹 Step 1: Client Initiation

Enters Citibank onboarding portal or mobile app

Chooses Business Account + optional services (FX, Credit)

Uploads: Certificate of Incorporation, EIN letter, IRS Form W-9, company website link


🔹 Step 2: AI Document Processing

OCR & AI Parser (e.g., AWS Textract, Google Document AI):

Extracts legal name, entity type, registered agent, UBOs, etc.


Cross-references data with state registry APIs (e.g., Delaware SoS)


🔹 Step 3: IRS Form Intelligence Engine

Detects client is U.S. entity → auto-generates pre-filled IRS W-9

For foreign clients: auto-detects need for W-8BEN/W-8IMY


🔹 Step 4: UBO & Beneficial Ownership Logic

Uses LLMs + rule engine to detect ownership > 25%

Constructs ownership tree & highlights missing documents

Flags if the entity is:

FinCEN-reportable

Layered through trusts or shell firms



🔹 Step 5: OFAC & Watchlist Checks

Entity + UBOs scanned in real-time:

OFAC SDN List

FinCEN alerts

Interpol/UN sanctions

Internal Citibank flagged clients



🔹 Step 6: Client Copilot Interaction (LLM)

GPT-based chatbot helps fill forms, explain tax documents, and compliance steps:

“What is a W-9?”

“Why do I need a Certificate of Incumbency?”



🔹 Step 7: Product-Specific KYC Routing

System dynamically detects if extra KYC is needed:

For FX products → asks for source of funds, trade agreements

For lending → asks for cash flow statements



🔹 Step 8: AI Risk Profile Creation

Creates a 360° risk profile:

Entity risk (industry, geography, sanctions)

Owner risk (PEP, legal issues)

Transactional risk (expected activity patterns)



🔹 Step 9: Compliance Audit Trail Generation

Every AI decision logged:

“Why was W-9 selected?”

“Why is this owner reportable under FinCEN?”


Output stored in audit-friendly logs


🔹 Step 10: Core System Integration

Once verified:

Account created in core banking

Services activated (TTS, FX, etc.)

Credentials & dashboard provisioned
