Step 1: Import Libraries and Initialize H2O
python
Copy
Edit
import h2o
from h2o.estimators.gbm import H2OGradientBoostingEstimator
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Initialize H2O
h2o.init()

# Load dataset (replace 'your_dataset_path' with your dataset path or frame)
train_data = h2o.import_file("your_dataset_path")
Step 2: Define Monotonicity Derivation Function
This function checks the monotonicity of each feature with respect to the target variable.

python
Copy
Edit
def check_monotonicity(feature, target, train_frame):
    """
    Determines if a feature has a monotonic relationship with the target variable.
    Returns:
    1 -> Monotonically increasing
    -1 -> Monotonically decreasing
    0 -> Non-monotonic
    """
    df = train_frame.as_data_frame()
    df = df[[feature, target]].copy()

    # Bin continuous features into quantiles if needed
    if df[feature].nunique() > 10:
        df["bin"] = pd.qcut(df[feature], q=10, duplicates="drop")
    else:
        df["bin"] = df[feature]

    # Calculate average target rate per bin
    bin_avg = df.groupby("bin")[target].mean().reset_index()
    bin_avg["bin_idx"] = range(len(bin_avg))  # Index for monotonicity check

    # Check monotonicity
    is_increasing = np.all(np.diff(bin_avg[target]) >= 0)
    is_decreasing = np.all(np.diff(bin_avg[target]) <= 0)

    if is_increasing:
        return 1  # Monotonically increasing
    elif is_decreasing:
        return -1  # Monotonically decreasing
    else:
        return 0  # Non-monotonic
Step 3: Apply Monotonicity Analysis to Selected Features
You can apply the function to each feature of interest to determine monotonic constraints.

python
Copy
Edit
# Convert target variable to binary (if not already binary)
train_data["target_binary"] = train_data["target"].asfactor()

# Define features to analyze
features_to_check = ["high_density_swipe_score", "cnt_cnp_60days", 
                     "pct_cnp_amt_60days", "auth_decline_ratio", "dist_miles_btw_swp"]

# Determine monotonic constraints
monotone_constraints = {}
for feature in features_to_check:
    monotone_constraints[feature] = check_monotonicity(feature, "target_binary", train_data)

print("Derived Monotonic Constraints:", monotone_constraints)
Step 4: Train a Gradient Boosting Model with Monotonic Constraints
Once the constraints are determined, pass them into the monotone_constraints parameter of the H2O GBM model.

python
Copy
Edit
# Train a Gradient Boosting Model with Monotonic Constraints
gbm_model = H2OGradientBoostingEstimator(
    ntrees=500,
    max_depth=10,
    learn_rate=0.01,
    sample_rate=0.8,
    col_sample_rate=0.8,
    monotone_constraints=monotone_constraints  # Pass the derived constraints
)

# Train the model
gbm_model.train(x=features_to_check, y="target_binary", training_frame=train_data)

# Model Summary
print(gbm_model)
Step 5: Validate Monotonicity for MRM Documentation
Validate and visualize the monotonicity to ensure the constraints align with the observed data patterns.

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def plot_feature_trend(feature, target, train_frame):
    """
    Plots the trend of the feature against the target to validate monotonicity.
    """
    df = train_frame.as_data_frame()
    df = df[[feature, target]].copy()

    # Bin continuous features into quantiles if needed
    if df[feature].nunique() > 10:
        df["bin"] = pd.qcut(df[feature], q=10, duplicates="drop")
    else:
        df["bin"] = df[feature]

    # Calculate average target rate per bin
    bin_avg = df.groupby("bin")[target].mean().reset_index()

    # Plot the trend
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x=bin_avg["bin"].astype(str), y=bin_avg[target])
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.title(f"Trend of {feature} vs. {target}")
    plt.ylabel("Average Target Rate")
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.show()

# Visualize trends for key features
for feature in features_to_check:
    plot_feature_trend(feature, "target_binary", train_data)
Step 6: Document the Process for MRM
For MRM compliance:

Export the monotonicity derivation process and visualizations.
Include explanations of the trends for each feature (e.g., why the relationship is monotonic).
Emphasize that the monotonic constraints were derived from empirical data, avoiding manual rules.
Export Model and Constraints
python
Copy
Edit
# Save the trained model
model_path = h2o.save_model(model=gbm_model, path="path_to_save_model", force=True)
print(f"Model saved to {model_path}")

# Save monotonic constraints
import json
with open("monotonic_constraints.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(monotone_constraints, f)
Key Benefits of the Approach
Automated and Defensible: Monotonic constraints are derived directly from the data, removing manual bias.
Explainable to MRM: Visual trends and automated derivation ensure transparency.

What Are Monotonic Constraints in Machine Learning?
Monotonic constraints are restrictions applied to machine learning models that enforce a specific direction of the relationship between certain features and the model's predicted output. For example, if a feature is expected to have a positive effect on the target (e.g., an increasing score when the feature value increases), monotonic constraints ensure the model's predictions follow this logical or business-driven rule.

How Monotonic Constraints Work in Your Case
In your fraud detection model, monotonic constraints will:

Enforce Logical Relationships: Fraud risk typically increases as some features grow (e.g., high_density_swipe_score, cnt_cnp_60days). Applying monotonic constraints ensures that as these features increase, the model output (fraud probability) will also increase.
Prevent Inconsistent Predictions: Without constraints, machine learning models can exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as predicting lower fraud risks for higher fraud-indicative feature values due to overfitting. Monotonic constraints avoid this issue.
Enhance Interpretability: Constraining the model's behavior aligns predictions with domain knowledge. This improves model transparency and ensures it passes scrutiny by Model Risk Management (MRM) teams.
Control for Overfitting: Monotonic constraints act as a regularization technique, limiting the model's ability to fit spurious patterns and improving generalization.
Defend Against Challenges from MRM: Since the constraints are driven by data-derived monotonic relationships, they are defensible and explainable to MRM teams. This ensures compliance with regulatory and internal validation processes.
How Monotonic Constraints Specifically Help in Your Case
1. Feature: high_density_swipe_score
Behavior: As the density of swipe activity increases, fraud risk logically increases.
Problem Without Constraints: The model might predict a lower fraud probability for higher densities due to noise or overfitting.
Effect of Monotonic Constraints: Ensures that higher density leads to higher fraud probabilities, aligning with business expectations.
2. Feature: cnt_cnp_60days (Count of Card-Not-Present Transactions in 60 Days)
Behavior: A higher count of card-not-present (CNP) transactions is strongly indicative of fraud.
Problem Without Constraints: The model might predict lower fraud probabilities for high CNP transaction counts due to unrelated patterns in training data.
Effect of Monotonic Constraints: Enforces the logical trend that more CNP transactions increase fraud risk.
3. Feature: pct_cnp_amt_60days (Percentage of Card-Not-Present Amount in 60 Days)
Behavior: A higher percentage of CNP amounts suggests elevated fraud risk.
Problem Without Constraints: Without constraints, the model might show non-monotonic trends (e.g., higher fraud risk at low percentages and lower risk at high percentages).
Effect of Monotonic Constraints: Guarantees that increasing this percentage increases fraud risk.
4. Feature: auth_decline_ratio
Behavior: A higher ratio of authorization declines is a key fraud signal.
Problem Without Constraints: The model might misinterpret noise in this feature, predicting lower fraud probabilities at higher decline ratios.
Effect of Monotonic Constraints: Ensures the model predicts higher fraud probabilities for higher decline ratios.
5. Feature: dist_miles_btw_swp (Distance in Miles Between Swipes)
Behavior: Longer distances between swipes often correlate with fraud.
Problem Without Constraints: The model could fail to capture this relationship or behave inconsistently.
Effect of Monotonic Constraints: Enforces that longer distances lead to higher fraud probabilities.
How Monotonic Constraints Are Applied in H2O
In H2O, monotonic constraints ensure the partial dependence of the prediction on a feature remains strictly increasing (1) or strictly decreasing (-1). When training the model, constraints are applied as follows:

python
Copy
Edit
monotone_constraints = {
    "high_density_swipe_score": 1,  # Prediction increases as this score increases
    "cnt_cnp_60days": 1,           # Prediction increases as CNP count increases
    "pct_cnp_amt_60days": 1,       # Prediction increases as CNP percentage increases
    "auth_decline_ratio": 1,       # Prediction increases as decline ratio increases
    "dist_miles_btw_swp": 1        # Prediction increases as distance increases
}

gbm_model = H2OGradientBoostingEstimator(
    monotone_constraints=monotone_constraints,
    ntrees=500,
    max_depth=10,
    learn_rate=0.01
)
This approach ensures that the model respects logical relationships throughout the training process.

Why MRM Will Approve This Approach
Data-Driven: The monotonic constraints are derived from empirical analysis of the data (e.g., trends between features and fraud probability). This removes bias or manual rule-setting.
Explainable: Each monotonic constraint can be backed by intuitive business logic (e.g., higher auth_decline_ratio correlates with higher fraud risk).
Transparent Documentation: Visualizations of feature trends and monotonic relationships provide clear evidence to defend the constraints.
Aligned with Regulatory Guidelines: The constraints ensure the model behaves consistently and predictably, which is critical for high-risk applications like fraud detection.
Summary of Benefits
Improved Fraud Detection Scores: Monotonic constraints ensure high-risk cases (e.g., high-density swipes) yield appropriately higher fraud scores.
Defensibility: A data-driven approach to deriving constraints makes the model defensible in audits or MRM reviews.
Better Generalization: By regularizing the model, monotonic constraints reduce overfitting and improve performance on unseen data.
