You’re right—here’s the revised 3-slide set with an explicit Objective on Slide 1, matching your CompliAI reference style.

Slide 1 | Background & Process Inefficiencies

Title: AI for Customer Verification in Credit Card Fraud Detection

Objective: Rapidly and accurately verify genuine customers on flagged card transactions to reduce false declines, speed approvals, and lower fraud losses—without adding friction.

Background

Card fraud controls are tuned conservatively → many legit transactions get flagged.

Verification today relies on agent phone calls and manual judgement.

Voice + text signals during calls carry rich cues that can separate genuine vs. impostor behavior.


Process Inefficiencies

High false positives: Legit customers declined → repeat calls, escalations, churn.

Slow, subjective reviews: Inconsistent across agents/time; long handle times.

Operational load: Large volumes of low-risk cases consume capacity; true fraud may age.

Limited feedback loop: Hard to learn quickly from new fraud tactics; thresholds static.

Slide 2 | Our Solution – AI-Powered Verification Framework

Data Collection

Labeled call recordings & IVR logs (genuine vs. fraud outcome).

Speech-to-text transcripts, chat/email transcripts, CRM case notes.

Transaction context: merchant, MCC, device/IP, geo, velocity, historical customer behavior.


Feature Engineering

Acoustic: MFCCs, pitch, jitter, energy, speech rate, pauses/hesitation, voice quality.

Lexical/Semantic: intent entities, PII consistency, evasive phrases, claim–fact mismatches.

Behavioral: interrupt patterns, answer latency, cross-channel history consistency.

Risk context: device fingerprint risk, geo mismatch, prior decline streaks.


Advanced ML Models

Audio models: wav2vec2/BYOL-A for embeddings; LSTM/Transformer classifiers.

Text models: Transformer (e.g., RoBERTa) on transcripts for semantic cues & sentiment.

Structured: Gradient boosting/XGBoost on transaction + history features.

Ensemble & calibration: Stacked model outputs → real-time confidence score with explainability (SHAP).


Fraud Ops Oversight Hub

Case triage UI: consolidated audio/text/structured evidence, top reasons, score thresholds.

One-click actions: approve, step-up auth (OTP/biometric), or escalate.


Adaptive Control Layer

Continuous learning from agent outcomes; auto-tunes thresholds by segment/region.

Policy guardrails, audit logs, and performance monitoring (drift, bias, SLA alerts).

Seamless API integration with existing fraud engine & CRM.

Slide 3 | Impact and the Way Forward

Reduced Losses

15–25% reduction in fraud exposure via earlier detection of social-engineering/first-party patterns.

30–50% drop in false declines for targeted segments → fewer abandoned transactions.


Operational Efficiency

50–60% fewer manual verifications on low-risk cases; faster AHT on escalations.

Saves hundreds of FTE hours annually; focusses analysts on complex cases.


Reputation & Trust

Faster, fairer decisions → higher CSAT/NPS; transparent, explainable reviews.

Demonstrates strong customer protection without unnecessary friction.


Scalability

Extends to debit, BNPL, wallets, and account-takeover verification.

Works across geographies/regulatory regimes; plugs into existing contact-center stack.


Future Scope

Multimodal step-up: passive voice biometrics + behavioral biometrics in real time.

Agent co-pilot: live guidance & suggested probes during calls.

Proactive analytics: emerging scam pattern detection; segment-wise threshold optimization.
