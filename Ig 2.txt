💡 PoC #10: AI Client 360 Assistant for Relationship Managers

“Know Your Client in 30 Seconds — Not 30 Clicks”


---

🧠 Problem Statement:

Relationship Managers (RMs) spend 30–40% of their time manually piecing together a client's full profile from multiple internal systems:

CRM records (e.g., Salesforce)

Transaction systems (cards, wires, FX, lending)

Email or call logs

Treasury product usage

Exposure and risk reports

Onboarding/KYC documents


This leads to delays in client meetings, incomplete information during engagements, and missed cross-sell or upsell opportunities.


---

🚀 Vision:

> Build a GenAI-powered Client 360 Assistant that can instantly summarize a client’s profile, recent activity, needs, and next-best-actions — all in one conversational interface.




---

📍 Example Questions RMs Can Ask:

“What’s the recent transaction trend for Acme Corp?”

“Did they respond to our term loan proposal?”

“Which products are they not using compared to similar clients?”

“Give me a 1-minute prep for my 3 PM call with GlobalX Inc.”
