Perfect 👍 let me give you another Slide 2 (Our Solution) example for your 24x7 AI Financial Analyst — but in a different structure, so you can see variations and pick what fits best.

Here’s another version:

Slide 2 | Our Solution – AI-Powered Financial Co-Pilot

Step 1 – Data Unification

Integrate fragmented financial data from multiple silos (Risk, Compliance, Treasury, HR).

Scenario Simulations: Run “what-if” stress tests automatically.

Automated Benchmarking: Compare performance across peers / regions instantly.


Step 3 – AI Models & Automation

Predictive Models: Portfolio loss forecasting, credit risk alerts, liquidity gaps.

Generative LLM: Auto-create analyst reports with executive summaries.

Optimization Models: Suggest portfolio rebalancing and capital allocation.


Step 4 – Analyst Co-Pilot (24x7 Availability)

Always-on digital analyst assistant (MCP powered).

Provides dashboards, alerts, recommendations, and auto-generated regulatory reports.

Interactive “chat with data” capability for faster decision-making.


Step 5 – Continuous Learning & Governance

👉 This version is like a journey map (Step 1 → Step 5) instead of the pipeline blocks in your reference.
It works really well if you want to tell a story of how the system works step by step.

Would you like me to now convert both versions (pipeline & stepwise) into proper slide visuals so you can compare which looks stronger for your Ignite pitch?
