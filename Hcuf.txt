Perfect 🙌 Thanks for sharing both your one-slider and the reference 3-slider format.

Here’s how we’ll convert your idea “GenAI-Powered Regulatory Breach Explanation & Suggestion Engine” into a 3-slide structure like the reference (Background → Solution → Impact & Future Scope):


---

Slide 1 – Background & Problem

Title: GenAI-Powered Regulatory Breach Explanation & Suggestion Engine

Objective: Develop an AI-powered copilot to interpret, resolve, and communicate compliance breaches in real-time across global regulatory frameworks.

Background – Regulatory Complexity

Global banks (AML, KYC, Basel III, Volcker, CCAR, MiFID, FINRA, FCA, RBI, etc.) face thousands of breach alerts daily.

Current process = fragmented, manual, and highly time-consuming for analysts.

Analysts struggle to interpret context (rules, exemptions, technical details).

Delayed or inconsistent responses → higher fines, increased risk exposure, regulatory friction.


Process Inefficiencies

Alerts require legal + compliance + audit inputs, slowing down decision-making.

Breach explanations are often too technical, hard for regulators/business units to understand.

Missed contextual insights → repeated violations & reputational damage.

Slide 2 – Our Solution

AI Copilot for Compliance Breach Resolution

Core Components

Data Collection: Regulatory texts, audit memos, compliance reports, historical breach logs.

Feature Engineering: Contextual mappings (rule-exemption pairs, jurisdiction tags, thematic categories).

LLM-Powered Copilot:

Translates breaches into plain English explanations.

Suggests contextual actions (remediation, waiver, reclassification, documentation).

Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve aligned regulations & precedents.


Regulatory Oversight Dashboard:

Compliance officers view breach reasoning & GenAI suggestions.

Audit-ready trail of actions, decisions, and rationales.


Adaptive Feedback Loop:

Analysts’ corrections feed back into the model.

Reduces recurrence of repeated compliance breaches.



Example:
If AML/KYC breach is flagged, copilot → translates technical violation → maps to relevant rule/exemption → suggests corrective action → generates plain-English regulator-facing explanation.

Slide 3 – Impact & Way Forward

Estimated Impact

⏱ Faster Resolution: Breach resolution time reduced by 30–50%.

💰 Cost Savings: Potential savings of $25–35M annually from avoided regulatory fines.

🔎 Audit & Transparency: Audit-ready, explainable, regulator-traceable breach rationales.

🔄 Reduced Recurrence: Historical breach learnings embedded into model → fewer repeat violations.

🤝 Improved Risk Culture: Strengthens trust with regulators through transparent, explainable AI.


Scalability

Works across geographies & multiple regulatory frameworks (AML, Basel, CCAR, MiFID, RBI, etc.).

API-first design → easy integration into existing compliance & risk systems.


Future Scope

Extend copilot to predict future compliance breaches using pattern analysis.

Integration with real-time transaction monitoring systems for proactive compliance.

Build an enterprise-wide compliance assistant across legal, risk, and operations.

👉 This way, your one slider → expanded into a polished 3-slide storyline (Background/Problem → Solution → Impact & Future).

Do you want me to also design this in slide-ready text + visuals format (like the sample with icons/boxes) so you can drop directly into PPT?
