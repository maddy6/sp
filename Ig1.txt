Great. Let’s move on to PoC #9, a high-impact, high-ROI use case in the GenAI and risk management space.

💡 PoC #9: GenAI-Powered Fraud Narrative Generator

“Explain the Fraud in Human Language — Instant Fraud Storytelling for Risk Analysts”


---

🧠 Problem Statement:

Citi processes millions of transactions daily, and while fraud detection systems (like SAS, Actimize, Falcon) generate alerts with numeric scores and flags, they lack narrative explanations.

Risk, operations, and fraud investigation teams must manually:

Interpret flag combinations

Analyze transaction history

Cross-reference KYC data

Draft a coherent explanation for what happened


This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates bottlenecks in both internal escalation and external regulatory/audit reports.


---

🚀 PoC Vision:

> Build a GenAI tool that automatically generates a narrative explanation of suspected fraud or anomaly, based on flagged transaction patterns, customer profile, and prior activity.




---

🧾 Example Scenarios:

“Explain why this wire transfer to Kenya was flagged as suspected mule account activity.”

“Generate a narrative for ACH bounce pattern that looks like bust-out fraud.”

“Draft a 1-paragraph SAR justification for this card spending spike.”

🏗️ End-to-End System Workflow:

User Clicks on Fraud Alert
                 |
                 v
       [Transaction + Customer Fetch]
                 |
                 v
     [Context Builder Engine (Feature Parser)]
        - Extracts key signals from alert
        - Retrieves prior transactions, behaviors, device/IP data
                 |
                 v
      [Fraud Knowledge Graph]
        - Links patterns to known fraud types
        - E.g., mule account, bust-out, layering, phishing
                 |
                 v
       [GenAI Narrative Generator (GPT-4 / LLaMA)]
        - Generates human-readable explanation
        - Includes behavioral timeline, risk markers, typology match
                 |
                 v
     [Narrative Output]
       - Internal Risk Dashboard  
       - SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) Form  
       - Email for Fraud Escalation Team

🔍 Sample Narrative Output:

Fraud Type: Bust-Out Behavior (Likely Synthetic ID)

Narrative Summary:
The customer account was opened on June 2, 2025, and remained largely dormant for 45 days, showing minimal activity. Between July 20 and July 26, the account engaged in rapid high-volume purchases totaling $24,800 across electronics and gift card merchants. These purchases occurred across three different IP addresses and two U.S. states, all inconsistent with the onboarding location.

On July 27, the account attempted a withdrawal of the full balance via a linked external account. This pattern strongly resembles synthetic bust-out fraud: low-activity period followed by high-volume spend and rapid cash-out.

Recommendation: Escalate to Fraud Tier 2. SAR likely required.

⚙️ Key Technical Components:

Component	Description

Alert Ingestion Layer	Pulls flagged events from fraud detection systems (SAS, Actimize, internal rules engine)
Entity Resolution Engine	Maps user ID to KYC, device ID, location, previous transaction history
Typology Classifier (ML)	Classifies fraud types using supervised ML (trained on past labeled cases)
RAG System	Pulls examples of similar prior fraud cases + regulatory templates
GenAI Layer (LLM)	Crafts the narrative with timeline, context, recommendation
Fine-tuning Data	5,000–10,000 labeled SAR or fraud case narratives used for supervised few-shot generation



---

🧠 U.S.-Specific Enhancements:

Alignment with BSA/AML requirements

Auto-tagging for FinCEN SAR templates

Reference to U.S. financial typologies (FFIEC fraud definitions)

Compliance with USA PATRIOT Act section 314(b) collaboration protocols

Integration with Internal Watchlists and OCC Guidelines



---

📈 Benefits for Citibank:

Benefit	Impact

Time-to-Investigate	Cut down from 40 mins → 5 mins per case
Consistency	Narratives use standard risk language
SAR Filing Support	Drafts 80% of required fields
Training Tool	Helps new risk analysts learn fraud patterns
Regulatory Trust	Improves traceability and audit clarity



---

🧪 PoC Roadmap (3–6 Months):

1. Phase 1: Use historical flagged transaction dataset (~50K alerts)


2. Phase 2: Map to 15 core fraud typologies using risk team input


3. Phase 3: Create RAG-enabled LLM that can justify, explain, and recommend actions


4. Phase 4: Integrate into Citi’s internal fraud ops dashboards


5. Phase 5: Add cross-regional fraud pattern comparison layer (India ↔ USA ↔ LATAM)




---

💡 Strategic Impact:

> “Citi moves from just detecting fraud to also explaining fraud — fast, factually, and with audit-grade narratives.”



This PoC transforms fraud investigation into a real-time, explainable, and regulator-aligned capability, while reducing operational overhead and SAR filing friction.
