What is Score Calibration?
Score calibration is the process of adjusting the raw output scores of a model so that they are interpretable, comparable, and aligned with an existing standard (e.g., an older model, a vendor model, or real-world fraud probabilities).

In your case, you have:

A new model that assigns scores from 0 to 999.

An old model that also assigns scores from 0 to 999.

A need to calibrate the new model's scores so they match the scale of the old model or a vendor-provided model.

Why is Score Calibration Needed?
Consistency Across Models: If your fraud strategy relies on a score range (0-999), a new model with different distributions might not work well with existing thresholds. Calibration ensures smooth transitions.

Interpretability: If a score of 850 in the old model meant high fraud risk, the new model‚Äôs 850 should mean the same thing.

Regulatory & Business Requirements: Banks and financial institutions (like UBS) require stability in risk scores to avoid customer impact.

Better Decision-Making: Business teams rely on scores for fraud blocking and risk analysis. If a new model has a different scale, decision-making might suffer.

How Does Score Calibration Work?
Calibration ensures that:

)
P(fraud‚à£score=x)‚âàP(fraud‚à£calibrated_score=x)
This means that the probability of fraud for a given score should be consistent between models.

There are two common approaches:

1. Distribution Matching (Score-to-Score Calibration)
Your old and new models may have different score distributions.

If the old model assigns 10% of transactions a score > 900, the new model should do the same.

Methods used:

Isotonic Regression (non-linear mapping)

Quantile Matching (matching percentile ranks)

Polynomial Transformations (e.g., cubic or sigmoid functions)

2. Probability-Based Calibration (Score-to-Probability Mapping)
Convert scores to fraud probabilities.

Use logistic regression (Platt Scaling) or Beta Calibration.

If score = 800 in the old model had a 50% fraud probability, then 800 in the new model should have the same.

Example: Score Mismatch Before Calibration
Transaction ID	Old Model Score	New Model Score (Raw Output)
TXN1	920	980
TXN2	750	890
TXN3	600	740
Problem: The new model assigns higher scores than the old model.

Solution: Apply calibration so that 920 in the old model corresponds to 920 in the new model.

How to Perform Score Calibration?
Here are the steps:

1. Compare Score Distributions
Plot the old model score distribution vs. the new model score distribution. If they differ, you need calibration.

2. Choose a Calibration Method
Quantile Mapping: If the rank ordering of scores is good, but the scale differs.

Logistic Regression (Platt Scaling): If you need a probability-based transformation.

Isotonic Regression: If you want a flexible mapping function.

3. Apply Calibration
Use one of the following:

A. Quantile Mapping (Score Matching)

    calibrated_scores = np.zeros_like(new_scores)
    calibrated_scores[sorted_new] = np.sort(old_scores)
    
    return calibrated_scores

log_reg = LogisticRegression()
log_reg.fit(X, y)

# Apply the calibration
calibrated_scores = expit(log_reg.intercept_ + log_reg.coef_ * new_model_scores) * 999
C. Isotonic Regression (Non-Parametric Mapping)

üìå How to Calibrate Scores of Your New Model?
Since your old model (0-999) and new model (0-999) have different distributions, you need to calibrate the new model‚Äôs scores to align with the old model.

‚úÖ Common Score Calibration Techniques
1Ô∏è‚É£ Quantile Mapping (Most Common for Score Alignment)

Maps quantiles of the new model to the old model.

Ensures that if 10% of scores were above 800 in the old model, 10% are above 800 in the new model too.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Beta Scaling (Logistic Regression-Based Calibration)

Fits a logistic function to align score distributions.

Used in credit risk and fraud detection models.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Isotonic Regression (Non-Parametric Calibration)

Learns a monotonic function to transform scores.

Works well when the relationship between old and new scores is unknown.

Vendor Method






üìå Understanding How the Vendor Model Might Have Decided the Calibration Rules
Since the vendor model's calibration formula has threshold-based conditions, let‚Äôs break it down into logical steps to reverse-engineer their approach.

1Ô∏è‚É£ How Might the Vendor Have Determined the Calibration Conditions?
To determine the cutoff values (thresholds) like:

rrr_score_4 > 0

tca_mod_amt >= 1000

ucm_pos = '01'

ucm_scheme = 'I'

They likely followed one or more of these data-driven methodologies:

üìä (A) Statistical Analysis of Historical Fraud vs. Non-Fraud
Look at Past Fraud Cases

Analyze tca_mod_amt, rrr_score_4, ucm_pos, and ucm_scheme distributions for fraud and non-fraud transactions.

Find natural thresholds where fraud is disproportionately high.

Determine Where Scores Differ Significantly

If fraud transactions have a median tca_mod_amt of 1000+, they might set tca_mod_amt >= 1000.

If fraud is concentrated in ucm_pos = '01' or ucm_scheme = 'I', they select these as risk factors.

üìå How to Implement?

python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Boxplot for fraud vs non-fraud transactions on tca_mod_amt
sns.boxplot(x=df["fraud_flag"], y=df["tca_mod_amt"])
plt.title("Transaction Amount Distribution by Fraud/Non-Fraud")
plt.show()
üëâ This helps visualize cutoff points for tca_mod_amt or rrr_score_4.

üß† (B) Percentile-Based Threshold Selection
Compute percentiles of tca_mod_amt and rrr_score_4 for fraud transactions.

Pick a high-percentile cutoff (e.g., 90th percentile) for rule setting.

üìå How to Implement?

python
Copy
Edit
fraud_90p = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1]["tca_mod_amt"].quantile(0.90)
print(f"üìå 90th Percentile Fraud Transaction Amount: {fraud_90p}")
üëâ If fraud_90p is close to 1000, that might be why the vendor chose tca_mod_amt >= 1000.

üìà (C) KS Statistic for Optimal Threshold
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic finds the best split point for distinguishing fraud vs. non-fraud.

üìå How to Implement?

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

# Compute KS Statistic for tca_mod_amt
fraud_values = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1]["tca_mod_amt"]
nonfraud_values = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 0]["tca_mod_amt"]

ks_stat, p_value = ks_2samp(fraud_values, nonfraud_values)
print(f"üìå KS Statistic: {ks_stat}, p-value: {p_value}")
üëâ A high KS value means tca_mod_amt is a strong fraud indicator.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How Might They Have Chosen min/max Values?
The formula:

python
Copy
Edit
min(
    round(
        (rrr_score_4 / (rrr_score_4 + (1000 - rrr_score_4) * (150 / min(tca_mod_amt, 10000))**0.5)) * 998 + 1
    ), 
    999
)
Contains min() and max() to cap extreme values.

üìå Why Use min() and max()?
max(1, ...) ensures scores never drop below 1.

min(..., 999) ensures scores never exceed 999.

The min(tca_mod_amt, 10000) prevents large transactions from overpowering the score.

üìä (A) Examining Score Distributions to Set Caps
Check the highest and lowest scores in historical data

Decide on reasonable bounds (e.g., 1-999 for scores)

üìå How to Implement?

python
Copy
Edit
sns.histplot(df["rrr_score_4"], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of rrr_score_4")
plt.show()
üëâ If rrr_score_4 rarely exceeds 999, they cap it at 999.

üìà (B) Checking the Relationship Between tca_mod_amt and Score
If tca_mod_amt significantly impacts score, they might adjust it using a transformation.

üìå How to Implement?

python
Copy
Edit
sns.scatterplot(x=df["tca_mod_amt"], y=df["rrr_score_4"])
plt.title("Relationship between Transaction Amount and Score")
plt.show()
üëâ If tca_mod_amt has an upper bound effect, they cap it with min(tca_mod_amt, 10000).

3Ô∏è‚É£ How Can You Get the Calibrated Scores for Your New Model?
Now that we understand the vendor approach, let‚Äôs derive calibrated scores for your new model.

    return calibrated_score

# Apply the function

# Display Sample Results
print(df[["new_model_score", "rrr_score_4", "tca_mod_amt", "ucm_pos", "ucm_scheme", "calibrated_new_model_score"]].head(10))
üöÄ Summary: How the Vendor Might Have Done It
‚úî Used Fraud Analysis ‚Üí Checked tca_mod_amt, rrr_score_4, etc., for fraud concentration.
‚úî Used KS/Percentile Analysis ‚Üí Chose tca_mod_amt >= 1000 as a cutoff.

üîç Understanding the Constants (150 and 10,000) in the Vendor Model Calibration
The constants 150 and 10,000 in the vendor model calibration formula must have been determined empirically based on historical fraud patterns. Let's break it down logically:

üìå 1Ô∏è‚É£ What Does 10,000 Represent?
The expression:

python
Copy
Edit
min(tca_mod_amt, 10000)
suggests that 10,000 is an upper cap for tca_mod_amt in the formula.

üîé Possible Reasons for Using 10,000
Capping Large Transactions to Avoid Overweighting

If a transaction amount is too high, it may artificially inflate the score.

By capping at 10,000, the model prevents extremely high amounts from dominating fraud scores.

Empirical Upper Bound on Transaction Amounts

The vendor likely analyzed historical transactions and found that most fraud happens below $10,000.

Beyond this value, fraud rates may not increase significantly (i.e., diminishing returns in fraud detection).

üìå How to Verify?
Run a percentile analysis to see if 10,000 is a reasonable cap:

python
Copy
Edit
percentile_99 = df["tca_mod_amt"].quantile(0.99)  # Get the 99th percentile of transaction amounts
print(f"99th Percentile of Transaction Amounts: {percentile_99}")
üëâ If the 99th percentile is close to 10,000, it justifies the vendor‚Äôs cap!

üìå 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Does 150 Represent?
The formula uses:

python
Copy
Edit
(150 / min(tca_mod_amt, 10000))**0.5
This adjusts the weight of transaction amounts in the denominator.

üîé Possible Interpretations of 150
Scaling Factor for Transaction Impact

Larger values of tca_mod_amt reduce the denominator‚Äôs impact (i.e., high transaction amounts make the denominator smaller).

150 is likely a normalization factor to prevent extremely high or low impact from tca_mod_amt.

Derived from Fraud Rate Analysis

The vendor might have found that for fraud transactions:

scss
Copy
Edit
Median(tca_mod_amt) ‚âà 150 * sqrt(Threshold)
This would mean 150 scales the denominator so that it aligns with real-world fraud trends.

üìå How to Verify?
Compare fraud and non-fraud distributions to see if 150 is a meaningful divisor.

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
fraud_median = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1]["tca_mod_amt"].median()
nonfraud_median = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 0]["tca_mod_amt"].median()

print(f"Median Fraud Transaction Amount: {fraud_median}")
print(f"Median Non-Fraud Transaction Amount: {nonfraud_median}")
print(f"Ratio (Fraud / Non-Fraud): {fraud_median / nonfraud_median}")
üëâ If the ratio is close to 150, it validates this as a scaling factor.

üì¢ How Can We Derive These Constants for Our New Model?
üìå (A) Find the Right Cap for tca_mod_amt
Compute the 99th percentile and use that instead of 10,000.

python
Copy
Edit
new_tca_cap = df["tca_mod_amt"].quantile(0.99)
print(f"Recommended Cap for tca_mod_amt: {new_tca_cap}")
üìå (B) Find the Best Scaling Factor Instead of 150
Use fraud-to-non-fraud median ratio as an alternative.

python
Copy
Edit
new_scaling_factor = fraud_median / nonfraud_median
print(f"Recommended Scaling Factor: {new_scaling_factor}")
üëâ If this ratio is close to 150, then 150 was based on fraud scaling.

üîç Understanding (1000 - rrr_score_4) in the Vendor Model Calibration Formula
The expression:

python
Copy
Edit
(1000 - rrr_score_4)
is adjusting the weight of rrr_score_4 dynamically in the fraud score computation.
Let‚Äôs analyze what it represents and how it might have been derived.

üìå 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is rrr_score_4?
In most fraud models, a feature like rrr_score_4 could be:

A Risk Score from an External Vendor Model

A Pre-Existing Risk Score (e.g., from a previous fraud detection model)

A Machine Learning Output Score

Since the formula treats it as an input score, it is already providing some fraud probability or risk estimation.

üìå 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Does (1000 - rrr_score_4) Represent?
rrr_score_4 ranges from 0 to 1000 (assuming it follows a similar scale to your new model).

(1000 - rrr_score_4) acts as an inverse weight, meaning:

If rrr_score_4 is high (closer to 1000) ‚Üí (1000 - rrr_score_4) is small, reducing its impact.

If rrr_score_4 is low (closer to 0) ‚Üí (1000 - rrr_score_4) is large, increasing its impact.

üîé Possible Explanations
Balancing Effect

It downweights the contribution of rrr_score_4 when it is already high.

It increases the impact of other factors when rrr_score_4 is low.

Dynamic Score Smoothing

If rrr_score_4 is too strong (i.e., near 1000), this term reduces overconfidence in fraud detection.

If rrr_score_4 is weak, (1000 - rrr_score_4) amplifies the impact of transaction characteristics.

Empirical Score Adjustment

The vendor might have tested different thresholds and found that subtracting from 1000 provided optimal fraud capture rates.

üìå 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Find the Correct Equivalent for Your New Model?
To determine whether (1000 - rrr_score_4) is an optimal transformation, you can experiment with different transformations:

üîπ Option A: Check the Distribution of rrr_score_4
See if it‚Äôs skewed and whether subtracting from 1000 makes sense.

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.histplot(df["rrr_score_4"], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of rrr_score_4")
plt.show()
üëâ If rrr_score_4 is already well-distributed, subtraction from 1000 may be unnecessary.

üîπ Option B: Validate with Fraud/Non-Fraud Ratio
We can check whether (1000 - rrr_score_4) differentiates fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

df["adjusted_rrr"] = 1000 - df["rrr_score_4"]
fraud_median = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1]["adjusted_rrr"].median()
nonfraud_median = df[df["fraud_flag"] == 0]["adjusted_rrr"].median()

print(f"Median Adjusted rrr_score_4 for Fraud: {fraud_median}")
print(f"Median Adjusted rrr_score_4 for Non-Fraud: {nonfraud_median}")
üëâ If fraud transactions have a significantly different median than non-fraud, this transformation is useful.

üîπ Option C: Try Other Transformations
Instead of (1000 - rrr_score_4), test alternatives:

Log Transform

python
Copy
Edit
df["rrr_log"] = np.log1p(1000 - df["rrr_score_4"])
Power Transform

python
Copy
Edit
df["rrr_power"] = (1000 - df["rrr_score_4"])**0.5
Min-Max Scaling

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df["rrr_scaled"] = scaler.fit_transform(df[["rrr_score_4"]])
üìå Compare fraud capture rates using different transformations.

üì¢ Summary
‚úî (1000 - rrr_score_4) is a dynamic balancing factor, reducing the weight of rrr_score_4 when it is high.
‚úî This transformation was likely chosen empirically based on fraud patterns.
‚úî We can verify its effectiveness by testing different transformations.
‚úî Alternative methods like log-scaling or power transforms might improve calibration.

You said:
rrr_score_4 ranges from 0 to 999. 

What Does (1000 - rrr_score_4) Represent?

So question is still what is 1000 and what might this is . Can you please think deeply


ChatGPT said:
You're asking a very precise and insightful question: What exactly is "1000" in (1000 - rrr_score_4), and why is it used?

Let's break it down systematically and uncover the reasoning behind this choice.

üîç Step 1: Understanding rrr_score_4 Range
rrr_score_4 ranges from 0 to 999.

Since rrr_score_4 is a fraud risk score, higher values likely indicate higher fraud risk.

In many models, scores are scaled between 0-999 or 0-1000 for standardization.

üîç Step 2: What Does (1000 - rrr_score_4) Do?
Mathematically:

If rrr_score_4 = 0, then 1000 - 0 = 1000 (Maximum weight applied)

If rrr_score_4 = 999, then 1000 - 999 = 1 (Minimal weight applied)

üß† Key Observations:

This transformation inverts the scale:

Higher rrr_score_4 (higher fraud risk) ‚Üí Lower weight

Lower rrr_score_4 (lower fraud risk) ‚Üí Higher weight

The formula dynamically scales down high scores and boosts lower scores in some way.

üîç Step 3: Why 1000?
Possibilities:
1Ô∏è‚É£ 1000 is a Theoretical Maximum Risk Score
Some vendor models use a "max risk score" concept.

1000 might be the absolute risk limit (even though rrr_score_4 is capped at 999).

This means (1000 - rrr_score_4) is a complementary risk adjustment.

2Ô∏è‚É£ It Creates a More Balanced Scaling
In many risk models, score distributions are skewed.

Subtracting from a fixed upper bound (like 1000) can stabilize score distributions.

This is especially useful for fraud detection, where scores tend to cluster toward higher values.

3Ô∏è‚É£ It May Have Been Chosen Empirically
Vendors likely tested different maximum values (e.g., 900, 950, 1000, 1100) and found 1000 worked best.

This could be based on:

Fraud capture rates

Score stability over time

Business thresholds

4Ô∏è‚É£ 1000 Keeps Scores in a Standardized Range
Many fraud scoring systems use a 0-999 or 0-1000 scale.

Using 1000 ensures output scores remain within expected ranges.

This helps in downstream model compatibility.

üîç Step 4: How Can You Verify This for Your New Model?
You can test whether 1000 is the right threshold for your new model.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Try Different Max Score Adjustments
Test different values like 950, 1000, 1050, or 1100 and see which gives better fraud capture.

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

df["adjusted_950"] = 950 - df["rrr_score_4"]
df["adjusted_1000"] = 1000 - df["rrr_score_4"]
df["adjusted_1100"] = 1100 - df["rrr_score_4"]

print(df[["adjusted_950", "adjusted_1000", "adjusted_1100"]].describe())
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Fraud vs. Non-Fraud Score Distributions
python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.kdeplot(df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1]["adjusted_1000"], label="Fraud", fill=True)
sns.kdeplot(df[df["fraud_flag"] == 0]["adjusted_1000"], label="Non-Fraud", fill=True)
plt.legend()
plt.title("Fraud vs. Non-Fraud Adjusted Scores")
plt.show()
üëâ If 1000 works best at differentiating fraud vs. non-fraud, it‚Äôs the right choice!

üì¢ Final Answer: Why 1000?
‚úî 1000 is likely the theoretical maximum score in the vendor‚Äôs fraud model.
‚úî It inverts the fraud risk, making high scores contribute less and low scores contribute more.
‚úî It was probably tested empirically to maximize fraud capture while keeping scores balanced.
‚úî You can experiment with alternative values (like 950 or 1100) to see if a different max score improves results.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Script: Automatically Find Best Max-Score Threshold
This script will:

Test different max-score values (950, 1000, 1050, 1100)

Compare fraud vs. non-fraud score distributions

Find the optimal value that best separates fraud and non-fraud cases.

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

# Simulated fraud detection dataset
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "rrr_score_4": np.random.randint(0, 1000, 10000),
    "tca_mod_amt": np.random.uniform(10, 5000, 10000),
    "fraud_flag": np.random.choice([0, 1], size=10000, p=[0.97, 0.03])  # 3% fraud rate
})

# Define different max-score thresholds
max_scores = [950, 1000, 1050, 1100]

# Store KS values to find the best threshold
ks_results = {}

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

for max_score in max_scores:
    df[f"adjusted_{max_score}"] = max_score - df["rrr_score_4"]
    
    # KS Test to measure how well fraud and non-fraud distributions separate
    ks_stat, _ = ks_2samp(df[df["fraud_flag"] == 1][f"adjusted_{max_score}"],

plt.show()

# Find the best max-score threshold
best_max_score = max(ks_results, key=ks_results.get)
print(f"Best max-score threshold based on KS separation: {best_max_score}")
üîπ What This Code Does
Tests multiple values (950, 1000, 1050, 1100) for (max - rrr_score_4).

Uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to measure how well fraud and non-fraud distributions separate.

Plots fraud vs. non-fraud KDE distributions.

Selects the best threshold based on KS-statistic (higher = better separation).

2Ô∏è‚É£ New Model Score Calibration Formula
Now, let's create a similar calibration formula for your new model.

Assumptions:
rrr_score_4 still ranges 0-999.

tca_mod_amt is used as a risk factor.

ucm_pos, ucm_scheme, and other conditions need to be found through data analysis.

We'll dynamically learn the best transformation factors.

def calibrated_score(rrr_score_4, tca_mod_amt, ucm_pos, ucm_scheme, best_max_score=1000):
    """

    """
    # Check fraud conditions (modify based on real fraud patterns)
    if rrr_score_4 > 0 and tca_mod_amt >= 1000 and ucm_pos == '01' and ucm_scheme == 'I':
        return max(1, min(
            round(
                (rrr_score_4 / (rrr_score_4 + (best_max_score - rrr_score_4) * (150 / min(tca_mod_amt, 10000))**0.5)) * 998 + 1
            ),
            999
        ))
    else:
        return rrr_score_4  # No transformation if conditions are not met

# Example usage
df["calibrated_score"] = df.apply(lambda row: calibrated_score(row["rrr_score_4"], row["tca_mod_amt"], "01", "I"), axis=1)
üîπ Explanation of This Formula
Uses best_max_score (found in Step 1) instead of hardcoded 1000.

Uses a fraud condition (modify as per data insights).

Applies a transformation similar to the vendor model.

Ensures scores remain between 1-999.

üöÄ Next Steps
