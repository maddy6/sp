💡 PoC #11: GenAI Regulatory & Policy Compliance Copilot

“Answer Any Regulatory or Internal Policy Question in Seconds — Not Days”


---

🧠 Problem Statement:

Employees across departments (risk, finance, operations, compliance, legal) frequently need to interpret complex regulations like:

U.S. SEC, FINRA, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, Basel III, etc.

Internal compliance manuals and policy documents

Sanctions screening policies (e.g., OFAC lists)

FATCA, AML, KYC obligations

Guidelines for lending, trading, custody, derivatives


Right now, they rely on:

Browsing 100+ page PDFs or SharePoint folders

Emailing central compliance teams

Slow, error-prone manual interpretations



---

🚀 Vision:

> Deploy a GenAI-powered Compliance Copilot that can answer regulatory and policy questions in natural language, backed by citations, and tailored to department-specific contexts.




---

📍 Example Questions the Copilot Can Answer:

“Can we onboard a client from Iran if they hold dual citizenship?”

“What’s the holding period requirement under SEC Rule 144?”

“When do I need to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)?”

“What are TTS documentation requirements for cross-border USD flows?”

“What is the risk classification for crypto-exchange clients?”

📋 Output Example:

> Q: What is the threshold for filing a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) in the U.S.?

A (generated by Copilot):

Under FinCEN guidelines, a SAR must be filed when a transaction involves $5,000 or more and the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the funds are derived from illegal activity or designed to evade regulations.

✅ Citation: FinCEN SAR Guidelines, p. 27
✅ Internal SOP Link: “SAR Filing Procedures – Citi Compliance Handbook, 2024 Edition (Section 3.4)”

Connects with internal SharePoint or Confluence documents

Context-aware — recognizes regional policy conflicts (e.g., FATCA vs. local tax treaties)

Generates audit-proof responses with citations and response logs

Suggests escalation paths (e.g., contact compliance officer if ambiguity detected)

🧪 PoC Rollout Plan (4–5 Months):

1. Phase 1: Ingest public U.S. regulations (SEC, AML, OFAC)


2. Phase 2: Add internal policies (TTS, lending, onboarding, risk)


3. Phase 3: Pilot with Legal, Ops, RM desk (15–20 users)


4. Phase 4: Add voice + Slack/Teams integration


5. Phase 5: Expand to full region and add escalation workflow
